
>>>Camel case notation:
-> first word lower case, all next words starting with a capital
var lastName, age, myFirstSony

>>>Dynamic typing:
-> Data types are automatically assigned to to variables
var lastName = 'Jansen';    //string
var lastName = 4711;        //number
var lastName = true;        //boolean
var lastName;               //undefined; variable has no value
var lastName = null;        //non-existent value

>>>Type coercion:
-> Data types are altered automatically when used
-> coercion = cast conversion
var lastName = 'Jansen';
var age = 28;
console.log(lastName + ' is' + age + ' old'); //age is converted to a string

>>>Variable mutation:
-> The type of variables are automatically mutated when declared
var age = 28;
age = 'twenty eight';//type mutated from number to string

>>>Output:
console.log();              //Output to console
alert();                    //Output in a popup window
var something = prompt();   //Output question, inputs result in variable

>>>Basic operators
Math:
-> 
- + * etc.
Logical:
> < etc.
Typeof:
var age = 28;
console.log(typeof age); -> the type "number" is shown

>>>Operator precedence
-> Operator order of execution 
a + b >= c

>>>Multiple assignment
var x,y;
x=y=20; //assignment operator works from right to left

>>>More operators
var x;
x = x + 1;
x += 1;
x++;
